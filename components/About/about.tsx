  "Hey, Iâ€™m Madison! Iâ€™m a 22 year old nursing student, expected to graduate in 2024. I am passionate about working with people and providing compassionate care. I currently work as a paediatric support worker and hope to continue working with children as a paediatric nurse in the future. I have been vegan since I was 14 years old and love discovering new plant based food spots where-ever we go (Iâ€™m working on converting Sanjar to the plant based life too). I also love to read, run, hike, and explore new places in the world. Iâ€™m always looking forward to our next adventure!";

        We are Madison and Sanjar, a couple who is passionate about travelling
        and seeing how life unfolds in different places.
        <br />
        <br />
        We met in 2020 while working at Starbucks. Madison was working as a
        student barista for four years already while studying to be a nurse.
        Whereas Sanjar was working as a part-time barista while in search of a
        software engineering job.
        <br />
        <br />
        It was our first trip together to Mexico in 2022 that sparked our desire
        to see more of the world together and create a platform to share our
        journey. After this we began traveling together as much as our budget
        and free time from work or school allowed us!
        <br />
        <br />
        We share a passion for reading, drinking coffee, adventures, and
        fitness. We hope to inspire others to get out and experience the world
        in a similar way, as this is something we all took for granted prior to
        2020!
        <br />
        <br />
        Through our blog and social media platforms we will share our tips,
        tricks, and authentic experiences! Hope you follow along our journey!
        <br />
